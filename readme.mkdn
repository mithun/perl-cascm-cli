# NAME

CASCM::CLI - A unified CLI for CA Harvest SCM

# USAGE

    hv [options] subcommand [options] [arguments]

# DESCRIPTION

`hv` provides a unified, context aware CLI for CA Harvest SCM.

# CONTEXT

`hv` looks for, collects, merges and passes on context and options to
underlying Harvest commands. This allows context to be configured in
various locations.

Context files are `.ini` files. Please see the documentation in
[CASCM::Wrapper](https://metacpan.org/pod/CASCM::Wrapper) for the format and examples of context files.

The following precedence is used when merging context from various
sources.

- command-line

        hv hci -st Developement

    Harvest CLI options can be provided directly on the command line, just
    like you would when running harvest commands directly

- Project-specific Context

    The project context is a context file `.hvcontext` in the current
    directory

- User-specific Context

    The user's context file defaults to `.hvcontext` in the user's home
    directory. This can also be specified using the `HVCONTEXT`
    environment variable.

- System-wide Context

    The system wide context file defaults to `$CA_SCM_HOME/hvcontext` or
    `$HARVEST_HOME/hvcontext`

# LOGGING

Unlike harvest commands, `hv` will, by default, log to STDOUT(or
STDERR). Harvest specific log files are not created.

# SUBCOMMANDS

Almost all harvest commands are supported as subcommands. Please see
[CASCM::Wrapper](https://metacpan.org/pod/CASCM::Wrapper) for a full list of supported commands.
